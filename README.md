# Project-Landing-Page
2nd Project following The Odin Project, creating a whole website with provided design

In this project I am going to create a whole website with provided design found on https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page . The credits considering all the style and images go to this weppage.

The skills I need to complete this task is what I have learned so far about HTML and CSS with a major focus on flexbox.
